It has only been 9 months since I landed my first job as a web developer but it feels like I have accomplished a lot of unexpected (but desired) goals.
So, I’ve decided to start this new decade with some achievable goals in mind, which I intend to get done by the end of 2020.

One of those goals was to commit myself to write my thoughts as blog articles as my personal web developer diary and also to share them with anyone who might find them interesting or helpful.

A few days ago I stumbled upon this tweet from [@jbrooksuk](https://twitter.com/jbrooksuk):

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Published! You can read it at <a href="https://t.co/3J783VDbui">https://t.co/3J783VDbui</a></p>&mdash; James Brooks (@jbrooksuk) <a href="https://twitter.com/jbrooksuk/status/1212397225843793920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>

That was the trigger for me to start writing my own personal blog using GitHub pages.
I followed a similar setup path as James but still encountered some issues during deployment which I’ll explain in a future post.

Until then, happy 2020!
